    <h1>Introduction to Operating Systems</h1>
    <p class="description">
      An <strong>Operating System (OS)</strong> is a system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides services for computer programs. It acts as a bridge between users and the computer hardware.
    </p>

    <h2>üîé What is an Operating System?</h2>
    <p>
      The OS is responsible for resource management, user interaction, and running applications. Without an operating system, a user cannot interact with the computer hardware directly.
    </p>

    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Basic Functions of an Operating System</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Process Management:</strong> Manages process creation, scheduling, and termination.</li>
      <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Allocates and deallocates memory to programs as needed.</li>
      <li><strong>File System Management:</strong> Controls how data is stored and accessed on storage devices.</li>
      <li><strong>Device Management:</strong> Manages communication between the system and peripheral devices.</li>
      <li><strong>Security & Access Control:</strong> Protects data and resources against threats.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here‚Äôs a basic command to list files in a directory using a Unix shell:</p>
    <code>ls -l</code>

    <h2>‚ùì Common Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: Can an OS run multiple programs at once?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Yes, modern OS support multitasking, enabling multiple applications to run simultaneously.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Is Linux an OS or just a kernel?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Technically, Linux is a kernel, but popular distributions like Ubuntu or Fedora are complete operating systems built around the Linux kernel.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: What makes Real-Time OS different?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Real-Time OS are designed for tasks that require immediate processing, such as robotics or embedded systems.</p>
