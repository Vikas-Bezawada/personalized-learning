    <h1>Continuous Integration with Jenkins</h1>
    <p class="description">
      Continuous Integration (CI) is a key practice in modern DevOps that ensures code is integrated frequently and consistently. Jenkins is one of the most popular open-source tools for implementing CI.
    </p>

    <h2>üîé What is Continuous Integration?</h2>
    <p>
      Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, usually multiple times a day. Automated builds and tests are run on each integration to detect issues early, ensuring that the software is always in a deployable state.
    </p>

    <h2>üìä Benefits of Continuous Integration</h2>

    <h2>üîÑ Jenkins Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Jenkins is an open-source automation server used to implement Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). It provides a robust, extensible, and highly customizable platform to automate repetitive tasks like testing, building, and deployment of code.
    </p>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Automation</td>
        <td>Automates the entire CI/CD pipeline, including build, test, and deployment processes.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Extensibility</td>
        <td>Supports a wide range of plugins for integration with various tools like Git, Docker, Maven, etc.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Distributed Builds</td>
        <td>Supports distributed build environments, allowing Jenkins to manage builds on multiple machines simultaneously.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Real-Time Monitoring</td>
        <td>Offers a detailed, real-time view of your CI/CD pipeline, including build status, history, and logs.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>üîß Jenkins Workflow</h2>
    <p>
      A typical Jenkins CI workflow involves the following steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Code Commit:</strong> Developers commit code to the version control system (e.g., Git).</li>
      <li><strong>Jenkins Build Trigger:</strong> Jenkins automatically detects the new commit and triggers the build process.</li>
      <li><strong>Build Process:</strong> Jenkins fetches the code, compiles it, and runs automated tests (unit tests, integration tests).</li>
      <li><strong>Test Execution:</strong> Automated test suites run to ensure code quality.</li>
      <li><strong>Build Status Report:</strong> Jenkins provides feedback on the build status (success or failure) to the team.</li>
      <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> If the build is successful, Jenkins can deploy the code to the staging or production environment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Jenkins</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to set up Jenkins for Continuous Integration:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Install Jenkins:</strong> Download and install Jenkins on your server (Windows, macOS, or Linux).</li>
      <li><strong>Install Required Plugins:</strong> Jenkins supports a wide range of plugins for version control, build tools, testing frameworks, etc. Popular plugins include Git, Maven, Gradle, JUnit, and Docker.</li>
      <li><strong>Create a New Job:</strong> Jenkins jobs are the tasks that define your build process. Create a new job (e.g., Freestyle project or Pipeline).</li>
      <li><strong>Configure the Job:</strong> Set up version control (Git), build triggers (e.g., commit pushes), and build scripts (e.g., Maven or Gradle).</li>
      <li><strong>Run the Job:</strong> Trigger the job manually or set it up to run automatically with each code commit or at scheduled intervals.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Common Jenkins Commands</h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Command</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>java -jar jenkins.war</td>
        <td>Starts Jenkins server (run in terminal/command prompt).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>curl -X GET http://localhost:8080</td>
        <td>Checks if Jenkins is running locally.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>git clone <i>repo-url</i></td>
        <td>Clones the repository to your local machine for Jenkins to build.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>mvn clean install</td>
        <td>Builds the project using Maven.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>docker build -t <i>image-name</i></td>
        <td>Builds a Docker image for your project.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>üìö Jenkins Pipelines</h2>
    <p>
      Jenkins Pipelines are an advanced feature that allow for defining your entire build, test, and deployment process as code. Pipelines use a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that allows you to configure CI/CD workflows programmatically.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Declarative Pipeline:</strong> A simple and structured way to define your Jenkins pipeline with stages like build, test, and deploy.</li>
      <li><strong>Scripted Pipeline:</strong> Offers full flexibility and customization by using Groovy scripts for more complex workflows.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>‚úÖ Jenkins Best Practices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure your pipeline is idempotent‚Äîeach execution should produce the same result regardless of the previous state.</li>
      <li>Use version control (e.g., Git) for Jenkinsfiles and pipeline configurations.</li>
      <li>Regularly clean up old Jenkins jobs to avoid system overload.</li>
      <li>Monitor your Jenkins environment and set up alerts for failed builds or any system errors.</li>
      <li>Use parallel execution for faster builds when possible, especially in large projects.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>‚ùì Common Jenkins Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: What is the difference between Jenkins Freestyle project and Jenkins Pipeline?</strong></p>
    <p>A: A Freestyle project is a simple job configuration, whereas a Jenkins Pipeline provides a more flexible and scalable solution, enabling you to define the build, test, and deployment process in code.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Can Jenkins integrate with Docker?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Yes, Jenkins can integrate with Docker for building, testing, and deploying applications using Docker containers.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: How do I monitor Jenkins performance?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Jenkins provides built-in monitoring features like job logs and status pages. Additionally, you can integrate Jenkins with monitoring tools like Prometheus for real-time performance tracking.</p>

    <h2>üéØ Pro Tip</h2>
    <p>Master <strong>Jenkins Pipelines</strong> and <strong>Jenkinsfiles</strong>‚Äîthese will enable you to define complex CI/CD workflows programmatically and scale your automation efforts.</p>
