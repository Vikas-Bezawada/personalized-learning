    <h1>Networking Protocols</h1>
    <p class="description">
      Protocols are rules that define how data is transmitted over networks. They ensure devices can communicate effectively, securely, and reliably.
    </p>

    <h2>üåê 1. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)</h2>
    <p>
      HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the web. It is used to load webpages by transferring hypertext between a client (browser) and server.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses port <strong>80</strong>.</li>
      <li>Stateless protocol (each request is independent).</li>
      <li>Not secure (data is sent in plain text).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üîí 2. HTTPS (HTTP Secure)</h2>
    <p>
      HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP. It encrypts the data using SSL/TLS to protect against interception.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses port <strong>443</strong>.</li>
      <li>Encrypts communication between browser and server.</li>
      <li>Essential for e-commerce, banking, and secure logins.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üì¶ 3. FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</h2>
    <p>
      FTP is used to transfer files between computers over a network. It allows uploading and downloading files from servers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses ports <strong>20</strong> (data) and <strong>21</strong> (control).</li>
      <li>Does not encrypt data (use SFTP/FTPS for secure transfer).</li>
      <li>Commonly used in website management and file sharing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üìß 4. SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)</h2>
    <p>
      SMTP is used to send emails from clients to servers and between mail servers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses port <strong>25</strong> (unencrypted) or <strong>587</strong> (encrypted).</li>
      <li>Handles <strong>sending</strong> emails, not receiving.</li>
      <li>Works with POP3/IMAP for complete email service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üì• 5. POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)</h2>
    <p>
      POP3 is used by email clients to retrieve emails from a server. It downloads and usually deletes mail from the server.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses port <strong>110</strong> (unencrypted) or <strong>995</strong> (secure).</li>
      <li>Emails are stored locally after download.</li>
      <li>Simple but doesn't sync across multiple devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üìß 6. IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)</h2>
    <p>
      IMAP is a protocol that allows email clients to access and manage mail on the server without downloading.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses port <strong>143</strong> (unencrypted) or <strong>993</strong> (secure).</li>
      <li>Emails stay on the server and sync across devices.</li>
      <li>Preferred for modern email apps (Gmail, Outlook, etc.).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üì° 7. DNS (Domain Name System)</h2>
    <p>
      DNS translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into IP addresses that computers understand.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses port <strong>53</strong>.</li>
      <li>Acts like the internet's "phonebook."</li>
      <li>Vital for browsing websites by name.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üì® 8. DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)</h2>
    <p>
      DHCP automatically assigns IP addresses and network configuration to devices on a network.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses ports <strong>67</strong> (server) and <strong>68</strong> (client).</li>
      <li>Simplifies network management by avoiding manual IP assignment.</li>
      <li>Common in home routers and enterprise networks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üìä 9. SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)</h2>
    <p>
      SNMP is used to monitor and manage network devices like routers, switches, and servers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses port <strong>161</strong>.</li>
      <li>Collects performance and usage data from devices.</li>
      <li>Used in network monitoring tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üí¨ 10. Telnet</h2>
    <p>
      Telnet is an old protocol used to remotely access devices via command-line. It's insecure because data is transmitted in plain text.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses port <strong>23</strong>.</li>
      <li>Replaced by SSH for secure remote access.</li>
      <li>Still used in testing environments.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üîê 11. SSH (Secure Shell)</h2>
    <p>
      SSH is a protocol for secure remote login and command execution on network devices and servers.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses port <strong>22</strong>.</li>
      <li>Encrypts data, unlike Telnet.</li>
      <li>Widely used by system administrators and developers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üì∂ 12. NTP (Network Time Protocol)</h2>
    <p>
      NTP synchronizes clocks of computers and devices across a network to ensure time consistency.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uses port <strong>123</strong>.</li>
      <li>Critical for logs, security, and scheduling tasks.</li>
      <li>Used by servers, routers, and security appliances.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>‚úÖ 13. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)</h2>
    <p>
      ARP resolves IP addresses to MAC (hardware) addresses on a local network. It's crucial for LAN communication.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Operates at the network layer (Layer 3).</li>
      <li>Enables devices to locate each other on the same network.</li>
      <li>Used in switches and routers for routing decisions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>‚ùì Common Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: What‚Äôs the difference between HTTP and HTTPS?</strong></p>
    <p>A: HTTPS encrypts the data using SSL/TLS, making it secure. HTTP does not provide encryption.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Why is SSH preferred over Telnet?</strong></p>
    <p>A: SSH encrypts the connection, protecting against eavesdropping, while Telnet transmits data in plain text.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Do I need both POP3 and IMAP for emails?</strong></p>
    <p>A: No, they serve similar purposes but work differently. IMAP is preferred for syncing across multiple devices.</p>

    <h2>üéØ Pro Tip</h2>
    <p>Remember key protocol ports! Example: HTTPS (443), FTP (21), SSH (22), DNS (53).</p>
