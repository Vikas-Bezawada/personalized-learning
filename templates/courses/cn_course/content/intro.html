    <h1>Introduction to Networking</h1>
    <p class="description">
      Computer Networking connects devices, enabling communication, data sharing, and resource access across networks of all sizes.
    </p>

    <h2>üîé What is Computer Networking?</h2>
    <p>
      Computer networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources and information. Networks can range from small local networks (LANs) to vast global networks like the Internet.
    </p>

    <h2>üìö Types of Networks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>LAN (Local Area Network):</strong> Covers a small geographic area, like a home or office.</li>
      <li><strong>WAN (Wide Area Network):</strong> Spans large geographical areas; the Internet is the largest WAN.</li>
      <li><strong>MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):</strong> Covers a city or large campus.</li>
      <li><strong>PAN (Personal Area Network):</strong> Covers a very small area, like Bluetooth connections between devices.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Networking Devices Overview</h2>
    <p>Some important devices you‚Äôll encounter:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Modem:</strong> Connects to the internet via your ISP.</li>
      <li><strong>Hub:</strong> Basic device that sends data to all connected devices (now mostly replaced by switches).</li>
      <li><strong>Repeater:</strong> Extends the coverage area of a network by amplifying signals.</li>
      <li><strong>Bridge:</strong> Connects two LANs together.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üîÑ Common Networking Protocols</h2>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Protocol</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>HTTP/HTTPS</td>
        <td>Protocol for web communication; HTTPS is secured with SSL/TLS.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>FTP</td>
        <td>File Transfer Protocol for transferring files over a network.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>TCP/IP</td>
        <td>Fundamental communication protocol suite for the Internet.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>SMTP</td>
        <td>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol for sending emails.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>DNS</td>
        <td>Domain Name System resolves domain names to IP addresses.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>‚úÖ Example Networking Scenario</h2>
    <p>Imagine setting up a small office network:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Install a <strong>Router</strong> connected to the Internet Service Provider (ISP).</li>
      <li>Connect multiple computers to the <strong>Router</strong> via a <strong>Switch</strong>.</li>
      <li>Set up a <strong>Server</strong> for file sharing and backups.</li>
      <li>Secure the network using a <strong>Firewall</strong>.</li>
      <li>Provide wireless connectivity using an <strong>Access Point</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>‚ùì Common Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: What is an IP address?</strong></p>
    <p>A: An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network to enable communication.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: What is the OSI Model?</strong></p>
    <p>A: The OSI Model describes seven layers of communication functions needed for a computer network to work, from physical transmission to application-level interactions.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: What is the difference between a Router and a Switch?</strong></p>
    <p>A: A router connects different networks (like your home network to the Internet), while a switch connects multiple devices within the same network.</p>

    <h2>üéØ Pro Tip</h2>
    <p>Always secure your wireless networks with strong encryption (like WPA3) to prevent unauthorized access.</p>
