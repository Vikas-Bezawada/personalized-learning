    <h1>Routing & Switching</h1>
    <p class="description">
      Routing and Switching are the core functions that allow data to move across computer networks. Switching connects devices within the same network, while Routing connects different networks together.
    </p>

    <h2>üîÄ What is Switching?</h2>
    <p>
      Switching is the process of forwarding data frames between devices within the same network (LAN). Switches operate at the <strong>Data Link Layer (Layer 2)</strong> of the OSI model and use MAC addresses to make forwarding decisions.
    </p>
    <h3>üîé Key Functions of Switching</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>MAC Address Learning:</strong> Switches learn the MAC addresses of devices connected to their ports.</li>
      <li><strong>Frame Forwarding:</strong> Based on MAC address tables, switches forward frames only to the correct destination port.</li>
      <li><strong>Loop Prevention:</strong> Using protocols like STP (Spanning Tree Protocol), switches prevent loops that can crash the network.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üìä Types of Switching</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cut-Through Switching:</strong> Starts forwarding frames as soon as the destination MAC address is read, reducing latency.</li>
      <li><strong>Store-and-Forward Switching:</strong> Receives the entire frame, checks for errors, and then forwards it. More reliable but slower.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>‚ö° Benefits of Switching</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduces network congestion by creating separate collision domains per port.</li>
      <li>Improves performance by forwarding frames only to intended recipients.</li>
      <li>Supports VLANs (Virtual LANs) for segmenting networks logically.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üåê What is Routing?</h2>
    <p>
      Routing is the process of forwarding data packets between different networks. Routers operate at the <strong>Network Layer (Layer 3)</strong> and use IP addresses to make forwarding decisions.
    </p>

    <h3>üîé Key Functions of Routing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Path Selection:</strong> Routers choose the best path for forwarding packets based on routing tables.</li>
      <li><strong>Packet Forwarding:</strong> Uses destination IP address to forward packets to next hop or final destination.</li>
      <li><strong>Inter-Network Communication:</strong> Connects multiple LANs or WANs together, enabling global communication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üìö Types of Routing</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Static Routing:</strong> Routes are manually configured by network admins. Simple but doesn‚Äôt adapt to changes automatically.</li>
      <li><strong>Dynamic Routing:</strong> Uses protocols (like OSPF, EIGRP, RIP) to automatically adjust routes based on network changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>üöÄ Common Routing Protocols</h3>
    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Protocol</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>RIP (Routing Information Protocol)</td>
        <td>Uses hop count as metric, simple but not suitable for large networks.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)</td>
        <td>Link-state protocol, scalable and widely used in enterprises.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)</td>
        <td>Hybrid protocol used mainly in Cisco networks, combines best of RIP and OSPF.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)</td>
        <td>Used to route between different organizations (Internet routing protocol).</td>
      </tr>

    <h2>üîß VLANs (Virtual LANs)</h2>
    <p>
      VLANs are used in switches to segment a physical network into multiple logical networks. Devices in different VLANs cannot communicate without a router.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improves security by isolating sensitive data.</li>
      <li>Optimizes performance by reducing broadcast traffic.</li>
      <li>Requires Layer 3 routing to connect between VLANs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>üö¶ Inter-VLAN Routing</h2>
    <p>
      To allow communication between VLANs, routers (or Layer 3 switches) perform Inter-VLAN Routing. This enables devices in different VLANs to talk to each other.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Router-on-a-Stick:</strong> A single router interface handles multiple VLANs using sub-interfaces.</li>
      <li><strong>Layer 3 Switches:</strong> Can route between VLANs without needing an external router.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>‚ùì Common Questions</h2>
    <p><strong>Q: Can a switch perform routing?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Yes, Layer 3 switches can perform routing functions between VLANs or networks.</p>

    <p><strong>Q: Why do we use routers instead of just switches?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Switches connect devices in the same network, but routers are needed to connect different networks (e.g., LAN to the Internet).</p>

    <p><strong>Q: What is dynamic routing?</strong></p>
    <p>A: Dynamic routing uses protocols to automatically update routing tables based on changes in the network topology.</p>

    <h2>üéØ Pro Tip</h2>
    <p>Remember: Switches use MAC addresses (Layer 2), Routers use IP addresses (Layer 3). VLANs need routing to communicate across each other.</p>
